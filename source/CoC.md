GhostBSD Community Code of Conduct
==================================

The GhostBSD community is committed to fostering a respectful, inclusive, and productive environment for all members. To achieve this, we ask everyone to follow these principles:  

1. **Be friendly and patient.** Engage others with understanding and kindness.  
2. **Be welcoming.** Support people of all backgrounds and identities.  
3. **Be considerate.** Recognize how your actions and decisions impact others.  
4. **Be respectful.** Treat others with courtesy, whether they are part of or outside the GhostBSD community.  
5. **Engage constructively.** Handle disagreements by focusing on ideas, not individuals.  

**Unacceptable Behavior**  
The following behaviors are not allowed:  
- Threats or violent language.  
- Discriminatory remarks, jokes, or language.  
- Sharing explicit, violent, or private material without consent.  
- Personal attacks, harassment, or targeting based on race, gender, or other personal traits.  
- Repeated disruptive behavior after being asked to stop.  

If someone expresses discomfort or requests you stop certain behavior, assess whether your actions align with these principles. Persisting in objectively harmful behavior constitutes harassment.  

**Scope**  
This Code applies to GhostBSD-managed spaces, including forums, Telegram, IRC, GitHub, events, and any other community platforms. Enforcement is limited to behaviors that affect the communityâ€™s inclusiveness, productivity, or reputation.  

**Reporting and Accountability**  
Violations can be reported to **hello@GhostBSD.org**. Reports will be handled transparently and fairly. When appropriate, mediation may be offered to resolve disputes.  

By adhering to this Code, we ensure GhostBSD remains a positive space for all.
